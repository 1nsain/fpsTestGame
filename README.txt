Made this game for fun to try out unity not really that good plz do not download for your own safety
Optimsation
playermovement problem with difrent directions and varibles
adding weapons and animation
adding better sound effects and lowering the time of the sound loop

Other problems im not good at programming example
CollisionFlags flags = controller.Move(moveDirection * Time.deltaTime);
no idea why my programm dosent work without the varibale but it dosen't
the varible if never called while playing
