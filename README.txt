This project was made as a school project and is not espascilly good but i am improving on it
it is a basic fps game.

uses alot of charachtercontroller and mouse movment currently had a bug with unity that is why
file names are weird. reasoning behind this is that i wanted to learn more about unity and c#

download and run in unity

game is setup enough that you can currently test it and run around and shoot nothing more

Things that you can contribute and fix

playermovement problem with difrent directions and varibles
adding weapons and animation
adding better sound effects and lowering the time of the sound loop


Other problems, im not good at programming example
CollisionFlags flags = controller.Move(moveDirection * Time.deltaTime);
no idea why my programm dosent work without the varibale but it dosen't
the varible if never called while playing
